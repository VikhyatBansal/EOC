// Runs an infinite loop that listens to the keyboard input.
// When a key is pressed (any key), the program blackens the screen,
// i.e. writes "black" in every pixel;
// the screen should remain fully black as long as the key is pressed. 
// When no key is pressed, the program clears the screen, i.e. writes
// "white" in every pixel;
// the screen should remain fully clear as long as no key is pressed.

// Put your code here.
@24576 // Used to get 24576
D=A // Pass 24576 to D Register

@21 // Just a variable
M=D // Put the value of D into RAM[21]

(LOOP) // Start Loop here

@KBD // Base address of Keyboard Memory Map
D=M // Get the scan code and pass it to S


@10 // Variable
D;JGT // If D (scan code) is greater than 0 go to line 10

@LOOP // Loop from here
0;JMP // unconditional loop

@SCREEN // Get base address of Screen Memory Map. This is the 10th line
D=A // Store that in D Register

(MOMO) // Start Loop here
@fill // A variable -- also a pointer
A=D // Pass the value in D to A
M=-1 // Set value of M to -1 to turn on the pixels
A=D+1 // Increment A
D=A // Pass the incremented value to D

@21 // We declared this variable before. Its used to get 24576
D-M;JEQ  // Here if D-24576 is equal to 0 then jump to line 21

0;JMP // This is an unconditional loop.
